Fizz Buzz

Fizz Buzz is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!

Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% of programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems.

Want to give it a shot?

Write a fizzbuzz.c program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
